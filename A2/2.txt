I am using trello.com and google sheet to record my daily works.
In company jobs, it's important to report daily updates and planned works.
By using trello, I note all tasks to do with deadline and some comments for that.
Also, using google sheet, I am recording my working times per task for 8 hours of working each day.
My programming conductivity is making optimized resulting and meet the deadline of project.
